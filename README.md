### Hi! I'm Jeremy Hadfield
- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** finishing my bachelor's in philosophy and cognitive science (with a focus area in computational consciousness) at Dartmouth College, and searching for a job as an entry-level product/project manager, data scientist, or software engineer. See [my website](https://jeremyhadfield.com/) and [my Substack](https://imaginaries.substack.com/) to see what I'm thinking about lately.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** data science with Pandas and machine learning with scikit-learn.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** open-source projects on computational analysis of philosophical and literary texts, visualization and analysis of environmental issues, and projects or data analysis related to mental health. 
- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with** searching for a job, improving my technical skills, and making decisions about future careers! 
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** the new science of consciousness, realizing imaginaries, or existential philosophy. 
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me**: jhadfield129@gmail.com or jeremy.hadfield.21@dartmouth.edu
- âš¡ **Fun fact**: The number 0 was independently invented at least twice in human history: by the Mayans around 100 AD, and by the Babylonians around 400 BC. Zero was introduced to Europe by Fibonacci, or Leonardo of Pisa, in around 1200 AD. He brought back 0 and other Arabic numerals from his travels in the Middle East. 

## Some Projects on this Github
- **[AutoPulse: A Bot to Take COllegePulse Surveys](https://github.com/jerhadf/pulse-survey-bot):** This is an automated bot, built with Python and Selenium, to rapidly and automatically take all of the surveys on CollegePulse.com. To do this, I had to bypass Captchas, timers, and other questions used to prevent bots from taking the surveys. CollegePulse is now a successful startup accepted at YCombinator S18, and most of the code I wrote is still in use for automated testing.
