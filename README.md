- âš¡ **Fun fact**: The number 0 was independently invented at least twice in human history: by the Mayans around 100 AD, and by the Babylonians around 400 BC. Zero was introduced to Europe by Fibonacci, or Leonardo of Pisa, in around 1200 AD. He brought back 0 and other Arabic numerals from his travels in the Middle East.
