### Hi! I'm Jeremy Hadfield
- ðŸ”­ **Working on:** finishing a [Masters of Engineering Management](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/graduate/mem) at Dartmouth College (in November 2023)
- ðŸŒ± **Learning about:** how to build imaginative products with LLMs, AI ethics, and the engineering of climate change. See [Imaginaries](https://imaginaries.substack.com/) to see what I'm thinking about lately.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to collaborate on:** open-source projects on LLM tools for thought, visualization & analysis of environmental issues, and projects or data analysis related to mental health. Also writing, art, community-building!
- ðŸ¤” **Looking for help with** building technical ML skills, thinking about career pathways, critical feedback. 
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:** realizing imaginaries, conceptual engineering, existential philosophy, or AI tools for thought. 
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me**: jeremy.hadf@gmail.com, jeremyh.th@dartmouth.edu

## Some Sample Projects
- **[Using ML to Optimize Steel Utilization for Hypertherm](https://github.com/jerhadf/hyperthermDAPL)** _(machine learning, data analytics, databases, SQL, Python)_ Processed 100+ million rows of data from plasma cutting machines and built ML models to predict steel utilization with high accuracy. Created a plan to prevent ~5k metric tons of CO2 and save ~$52 million each year.
- **[Great Salt Lake Project: A proof-of-concept for LLM-based stakeholder analysis for environmental problems](https://github.com/jerhadf/GreatSaltLakeCrisisAnalysis)** _(AI, LLMs, LangChain, Python, data visualization, data analytics)_ Used chained LLMs to generate simulated interviews with stakeholder groups to find representative responses to environmental problems based on expressed opinions from text data on the web. Then, I validated and evaluated these generated interviews with real interviews. I also completed intensive research and data analysis on a key environmental and climate problem - the collapse of the Great Salt Lake watershed and its impending dessication (it's drying up!). 
- **[AutoPulse: A Bot to Take CollegePulse Surveys](https://github.com/jerhadf/pulse-survey-bot):** _(Python, automated testing, web scraping, Selenium, white-hat hacking)_ An automated bot I built with Python to rapidly and automatically take all of the surveys on CollegePulse.com. To do this, I had to bypass Captchas, timers, rate limits, and other questions used to prevent bots from taking the surveys. CollegePulse was in YCombinator S18, and most of the code I wrote is still in use for automated testing.
- **[CourseLoad: Aggregate Professor Reviews with Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jerhadf/courseLOAD):** _(Python, web scraping, NLP]_ A project I created with a partner for a Dartmouth hackathon, to solve recurring issues students experience when planning out course loads with scattered, incomplete information on courses and professors. We built a tool to aggregate professor reviews and turn them into a numerical score with sentiment analysis, and link them to course reviews. We later merged this functionality into the DALI Lab's DPlanner tool. 
- **[DALI Lab Data Challenge](https://github.com/jerhadf/data_challenge_22w)** _[Python, Pandas, data analysis, dataviz, machine learning]_ A series of data analysis projects for the DALI Lab at dartmouth. I analyzed a dataset on global macroeconomics using Pandas, and answered four key questions about the data using MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Plotly visualizations. I then used ML to predict macroeconomic outcomes.
