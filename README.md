## Sample Projects
- **[Using ML to Optimize Steel Utilization for Hypertherm](https://github.com/jerhadf/hyperthermDAPL)** _(machine learning, data analytics, databases, SQL, Python)_ Processed 100+ million rows of data from plasma cutting machines and built ML models to predict steel utilization with high accuracy. Created a plan to prevent ~5k metric tons of CO2 and save ~$52 million each year.
- **[Great Salt Lake Project: A proof-of-concept for LLM-based stakeholder analysis for environmental problems](https://github.com/jerhadf/GreatSaltLakeCrisisAnalysis)** _(AI, LLMs, LangChain, Python, data visualization, data analytics)_ Used chained LLMs to  to generate representative responses to environmental problems based on expressed opinions from stakeholders on the web. Validated and evaluated these generated interviews with real interviews. Intensive research on a key environmental problem - the collapsing Great Salt Lake watershed (it's drying up!).
- **[AutoPulse: A Bot to Take CollegePulse Surveys](https://github.com/jerhadf/pulse-survey-bot):** _(Python, automated testing, web scraping, Selenium, white-hat hacking)_ An automated bot I built with Python to rapidly and automatically take all of the surveys on CollegePulse.com. To do this, I had to bypass Captchas, timers, rate limits, and other questions used to prevent bots from taking the surveys. CollegePulse was in YCombinator S18, and most of the code I wrote is still in use for automated testing.
