### Hi! I'm Jeremy Hadfield
- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** finishing a Masters of Engineering Management at Dartmouth College (in November 2023), and working as a product intern at [Ought.org](https://ought.org/), based in Berkeley, CA. 
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning about** how to build products with LLMs, affective neurocience, and the engineering of climate change. See [my website](https://jeremyhadfield.com/) and [my Substack](https://imaginaries.substack.com/) to see what I'm thinking about lately.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** open-source projects on computational analysis of philosophical and literary texts, visualization and analysis of environmental issues, and projects or data analysis related to mental health. Also community-building stuff! 
- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with** improving my technical skills, thinking about life & career decisions, and 
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** the new science of consciousness, realizing imaginaries, or existential philosophy. 
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me**: jhadfield129@gmail.com (personal), jeremyh.th@dartmouth.edu (school), jeremy@ought.org (work)

## Some Projects
- **To add/update soon:**
  - Hypertherm final project - minimizing environmental impact of plasma cutting by optimizing steel plate utilization with machine learning 
  - Climate change & engineering final project (stakeholder analysis with LLMs, ecological economics)
  - Experiments with Langchain
  - Talk to Nietzsche -- an LLM chatbot trained on Nietzsche's full texts
  - Solarpunk digital art - digital art for an interactive solarpunk mural, created with generative AI and other computational methods 
  - **[Imagination in Artificial Neural Networks](https://github.com/jerhadf/imagination-ANNs):** _[technical writing, machine learning]_ An article with original research and technical writing on how imagination can be implemented and modeled in ANNs. Reviews major ANN architectures and algorithms that employ imagination-like mechanisms. This also exists as a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination_in_artificial_neural_networks) that I published and maintain. 
- **[AutoPulse: A Bot to Take CollegePulse Surveys](https://github.com/jerhadf/pulse-survey-bot):** _[Python, automated testing, web scraping, Selenium]_ An automated bot I built with Python to rapidly and automatically take all of the surveys on CollegePulse.com. To do this, I had to bypass Captchas, timers, and other questions used to prevent bots from taking the surveys. CollegePulse is now a successful startup accepted at YCombinator S18, and most of the code I wrote is still in use for automated testing.
- **[CourseLoad: Aggregate Professor Reviews with Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jerhadf/courseLOAD):** _[Python, web scraping, NLP]_ A project I created with a partner for a Dartmouth hackathon, to solve a recurring issues Dartmouth students experience when planning out course loads with scattered, incomplete information on courses and professors. We planned to overcame this by scraping all relevant sites & recommending sample courses depending on student specifications.  When we realised that the [DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/) was already building this tool, we instead built a tool to aggregate professor reviews and turn them into a numerical score with sentiment analysis. We later merged this functionality into the DALI Lab's DPlanner tool. 
- **[DALI Lab Data Challenge](https://github.com/jerhadf/data_challenge_22w)** _[Python, Pandas, data analysis, dataviz, machine learning]_ A series of data analysis projects for my application to the DALI Lab data team. First, I analyzed a dataset on global macroeconomics using Pandas, and answered four key questions about the data using MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Plotly visualizations. 
- **[Quote Displayer](https://github.com/jerhadf/quote-displayer):** _[HTML, CSS, Javascript]_ A website I built from scratch to retrieve a random quote (mostly from philosophy) from a database, and display this quote on a simple interface.
