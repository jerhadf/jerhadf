### Hi! I'm Jeremy Hadfield
- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** finishing my bachelor's in philosophy and cognitive science (with a focus area in computational consciousness) at Dartmouth College, and searching for a job as an entry-level product/project manager, data scientist, or software engineer. See [my website](https://jeremyhadfield.com/) and [my Substack](https://imaginaries.substack.com/) to see what I'm thinking about lately.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** data science with Pandas and machine learning with scikit-learn.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** open-source projects on computational analysis of philosophical and literary texts, visualization and analysis of environmental issues, and projects or data analysis related to mental health. 
- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with** searching for a job, improving my technical skills, and making decisions about future careers! 
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** the new science of consciousness, realizing imaginaries, or existential philosophy. 
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me**: jhadfield129@gmail.com or jeremy.hadfield.21@dartmouth.edu
- âš¡ **Fun fact**: The philosopher [Diogenes the Cynic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_of_Sinope) died in 323 BC while trying to consume a live octopus. Diogenes also famously met Alexander the Great, who asked Diogenes if he wanted anything. In reply, the Cynic said "Yes. stand a little out of my sun." 

## Some Projects on this Github
- **[AutoPulse: A Bot to Take CollegePulse Surveys](https://github.com/jerhadf/pulse-survey-bot):** _[Python, automated testing, web scraping, Selenium]_ An automated bot I built with Python to rapidly and automatically take all of the surveys on CollegePulse.com. To do this, I had to bypass Captchas, timers, and other questions used to prevent bots from taking the surveys. CollegePulse is now a successful startup accepted at YCombinator S18, and most of the code I wrote is still in use for automated testing.
- **[CourseLoad: Aggregate Professor Reviews with Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/jerhadf/courseLOAD):** _[Python, web scraping, NLP]_ A tool I created with a small a partner for a Dartmouth hackathon, to solve a recurring issue nearly all Dartmouth students experience when planning out course loads: information on courses and professors is hard to find and scattered across different resources. We planned to overcame this by scraping departmental sites, recommending sample courses depending on student specifications.  When we realised that the [DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/) was already building a tool to solve this proble, we talked to the DALI team and decided we would focus on aggregating reviews of professors and turning them into a numerical score with using sentiment analysis. We later merged this functionality into the DALI Lab's DPlanner tool. 
- **[Imagination in Artificial Neural Networks](https://github.com/jerhadf/imagination-ANNs):** _[technical writing, machine learning]_ An article with original research and technical writing on how imagination can be implemented and modeled in ANNs. Reviews major ANN architectures and algorithms that employ imagination-like mechanisms. This also exists as a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination_in_artificial_neural_networks) that I published and maintain. 
- **[DALI Lab Data Challenge](https://github.com/jerhadf/data_challenge_22w)** _[Python, Pandas, data analysis, dataviz, machine learning]_ A series of data analysis projects for my application to the DALI Lab data team. First, I analyzed a dataset on global macroeconomics using Pandas, and answered four key questions about the data using MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Plotly visualizations. 
- **[Quote Displayer](https://github.com/jerhadf/quote-displayer):** _[HTML, CSS, Javascript]_ A website I built from scratch to retrieve a random quote (mostly from philosophy) from a database, and display this quote on a simple interface.
